    0:17 -- Stephen walking
    0:49 -- Ilana joins
    1:16 -- Laura joins
    1:27 -- three poses
    1:47 -- hop, pause
    2:21 -- slinky
    2:37 -- resume walking
    3:04 -- staggered pauses, then staggered poses
    3:24 -- multiple speeds
    3:46 -- hop
    4:25 -- axial work
    4:56 -- on backs
    5:31 -- walking, arms swinging
    5:46 -- three inversion gestures!
    6:16 -- hop, lean
    6:30 -- conflict section (military turns)
    7:16 -- Ilana falls
    7:28 -- Stephen falls
    7:44 -- trade falling down
    8:06 -- military turns
    8:20 -- kneeling in places
    8:33 -- Stephen jump
    8:40 -- multiple speeds -- Laura slow
    8:57 -- others enter, faster
    9:15 -- walk together, then partnering
    9:50 -- very fast walk
    10:04 -- all in place, starting arms section

    How many feet are moving?
    Together or separate?
    Pauses (and triggers for the three poses in Laura's theme).
    Hop.
    Direction? Their 90 degree turns will be awfully hard to read, but very useful.
    We talked about animated circles or ovals appearing on screen in sync with the footsteps. I could use triggers for those.
    1:51 -- slinky -- maybe measure their distribution by averaging the X positions? (mean - xmin) / (xmax - xmin) will be lower when Stephen is further to the left
    I'm having trouble imagining distinguishing characteristics for the walking. I know there are three locomotive themes that the dancers do sometimes together and sometimes in counterpoint. Distinguishing them musically is a "nice to have" for me but only if I have time left over after working on the sections where I don't have any material. We might have to navigate through the different walking constructions based on the segment-to-segment cues that Lorne will do by hand.
    Pause at 2:00 -- and hop to start moving again
    2:30 -- a musically useful pause, but how to read their movement toward backstage?
    2:35 -- movement in canon, going into Laura's three poses
    2:50 -- multiple speeds -- speed shouldn't be too hard to read
    3:36 -- slower movements, adding arms -- for the music, here I have a sketch of building harmony by overlapping two-note chords, would be nice to trigger these based on their movements, or if not trigger directly, then control pacing by their level of activity
    4:02 -- I don't know how much you can get when they are lying on their backs -- some parameters for their degree of leaning? If technically feasible
    4:34 -- walking again -- can we get any of the arm swinging?
    4:49 -- I really love that gesture -- I know it's hard to read. All three parts -- Laura's slide, the inversion, and the other inversion -- have some higher-speed movement followed by a pause. Maybe some continuous data going higher when they are in transition between poses? (I'm writing more about this because it's such great movement, and I want to do something special musically for it.)
    5:19 -- stop walking, and lean -- another musically suggestive gesture! They're moving horizontally before the lean -- I'd watch for the feet to separate and the neck marker to move to the right of the feet.
    5:35 -- "conflict" -- important musically but not sure how to read in video.
    5:46 -- from camera distance, I can't make out what's happening here.
    6:10 -- "falling" section -- also important to represent musically -- one figure's markers will have a very low y spread during the fall
    6:28 -- height variation
    6:52 -- multiple speeds (something comic here?)
    7:20 -- partnering work -- new to me. Unclear what's readable here.
    7:35 -- lifts and twirls. Would like to have some musical activity when they spin, maybe a variation of the measurement in the arms interaction demo.
*** DONE Arms
    8:09 -- axial theme -- ideally I would get triggers for each gesture. Whether they come from video analysis or manual intervention doesn't matter to me.
    8:35 -- locomotive theme -- we already have the arms-interaction demo. In a couple of places, the dancers stop and move hands up together. The demo doesn't currently respond to that, but I'd like to make it do so. In those places, is it possible to read most of the points being relatively still while some in the middle move upward, and track the upward motion?
    9:09 -- "sunrise" -- would be very nice to have data about where they are in the arc
    9:15 -- hand stacking -- I hear little arpeggios in the music, not sure if each arpeggio needs to be triggered individually from video. It's probably enough to get a signal saying "stacking now" and then another saying "they're going down now," then "that bit's over."
    9:28 -- intricate sequence -- a pause with hands clasped behind backs, then the partnering bit flipping Ilana upside down, a repeat of Laura's slide from the feet section (I like recurring motives like this!), leading right into 9:40. I would love to know when the slide is happening, to echo the earlier musical gesture.
    9:40 -- "Shiva" -- locomotive theme in canon.
    10:10 -- swaying --> partnering. Still thinking what to do here. Probably some punctuation sound, instead of trying to compose to every movement. I'll need to decide where the triggers should be, or maybe the triggers don't have to be in the same place every time.
    10:36 -- axial theme, three levels
    11:10 -- duet partnering -- Before, I read this as Stephen teaching Ilana the axial sequence -- curiously, that relationship disappears with a smoother performance.
    11:43 -- manipulating Laura -- triggers similar to the regular axial presentation would be useful. Music and visuals should give the audience permission to laugh here!
    12:00 -- Laura becomes more active in the partnering, leading into the locomotive theme (short)
    12:06 -- Stephen's solo, wild movements -- arm positions relative to the rest of the body might be the most useful thing
    12:17 -- new material, interesting juxtaposition of cradling next to something that looks like drawing a bow. Fragments of the axial and locomotive themes -- for my stuff, it would be nice to know when which one or the other is happening.
    12:47 -- all three to the ground, then up
    13:01 -- Laura solo, mostly locomotive material, probably can reuse the arms-interaction code, but I think it should be more sparse there
    14:14 -- hand play, should start with the bleeps and bloops for the face dance

**** New video
     10:05 -- axial
     10:37 -- locomotive
     10:52 -- lifting from center (again a few seconds later)
     11:17 -- sunrise
     11:24 -- hand stacking
     11:57 -- intricate partnering sequence
     12:10 -- Shiva
     12:45 -- swaying, into another partnering sequence
     13:20 -- axial theme in three levels
     (restarted that at 13:54)
     14:37 -- Stephen/Ilana partnering
     15:08 -- picking up Laura, then manipulating her through the axial theme
     15:42 -- locomotive
     15:49 -- short solo from Stephen
     15:55 -- cradling, drawing bow sequence
     16:34 -- all three to the ground, then up
     16:50 -- Laura solo, mostly locomotive material
     18:08 -- screen in, Laura goes behind shortly after
     18:38 -- face dance

*** TODO Head
**** Face dance
     Can't see a lot of specifics in the run-through videos, but I remember
basically from the earlier close-up video. Mainly I'll need trigger
messages when something happens on Ilana's face. Later in the face
dance, the event density will increase (maybe a lot) and that should
be synced with video. Whether I'm driving (sending note data to Lorne)
or Lorne sends me data about the desired activity level doesn't matter
much to me. Probably it will be both.

**** Rest of the section
     I'd like to cue some changes in the music based on movement. Possible
parameters are the height of the additive synthesis structures,
triggers to initiate the sweeps up (maybe including data about how
fast), when to introduce new pieces of the drum rhythms, brightness or
dullness of the drum sounds... just brainstorming.

Since this section is basically written from my side, for me it's a
matter of adding movement responsiveness to something that is already
working. At this late date, it would be worth doing this only if it
will be a big improvement on what I have already -- changes introduce
risk and the payoff needs to be good to justify it.

Sorry this is not very specific. I have yet to watch the video while
playing the music so that the drums end right around 29:30. Then I
might notice some correspondences that would be worth picking up.

*** DONE Torso
    Drums can dwindle away toward 30:10, when Laura appears above the screen. Then silence. Well, I'd like to have some silence in this part before Stephen's solo begins. The silence could be interrupted by some sounds.

Mostly for Lorne -- for a lot of these places, I'm hearing more or less steady state sounds that develop some "internal modulation" as the dancers twist and bend and otherwise move away from center. That's probably a challenge to read, but I would love to have some measurement of how far away they are from "center" (at the beginning of this section, "center" is upright with head and torso squarely forward). It probably gets easier to read when their hands come out around 30:50, but it might be impossible in those first 30-40 seconds when the only visible markers will be the head and neck. (Bowing might be readable from changes in the vertical distance between forehead and neckline.)

31:45 -- Stephen solo (amazing work by the way) -- should be pretty easy to tell the difference between axial and locomotive moments. One thing I specifically want to catch is the hopping movement at 32:31. Also the arm raising. Standing still and initiating shoulder movement from the torso is probably going to be invisible to the video, but I feel like the sound should still reflect it.

33:10 -- Ilana enters, then Laura at 33:40. Same challenges.

c. 34:00 -- Energy exchanges. Maybe a lot to ask, but I'd love to be able to track the energy ball as it moves from person to person.

34:35 -- Locomotion again, then arm movements like throwing energy into space.

34:55 -- An inversion, similar to previous sections. I'd like to echo that musically.

35:05 -- some poses, and exchanging places behind the screen. Probably motion versus stillness is more useful than anything else.

35:35 -- echoing Stephen's solo material in unison (not completely unison)

(36:10 -- Short repeat of energy exchange)

37:00 -- Remove props, then Ilana's solo. Lots to read here: center versus off-center, axial versus locomotive, L-R pan position.

38:14 -- Stephen and Laura duet. Amount of movement is interesting, as is body orientation (standing versus lying down or in the middle of a lift). I'll leave this for a detailed reading later, since this seems to belong more to the whole body section. By the time Laura comes back in at 40:28, we are definitely blending material from other sections.

*** Notes
**** Silence when Laura walks in slowly (multispeed part toward end)
*** Sounds/processes [6/7]
**** DONE Harmony w/ arms - refine
**** DONE Slide/inversion gesture    
**** DONE [#A] Multiple speeds
     Coming... want to modulate between no pitch, normal pitch and "crispy" pitch
**** DONE Leaning - sketched, come back to this after doing multiple speeds
**** DONE Falling - reuse leaning, and extend clicky things
**** DONE Conflict - prototyped, stomping and snare-drumming
**** TODO [#C] Distinguish locomotive themes
*** Data needed from Lorne
**** The entire opening sequence, up to about 3:30, there isn't much to read except stepping speed (foot markers going up and down) and the horizontal spread between the dancers. Their speeds may be different -- that's useful for me to know.
**** c. 3:30 -- slower, more harmony -- movement velocity
**** lying on backs -- another buildup leading to this, then hold (a) chord(s)
***** the more they swing their legs, the more activity
**** slide and inversions -- three triggers
**** leaning -- they're stationary -- I'd like to know when they stop moving
**** conflict -- can we tell when they change direction (attack/retreat)?
**** Falling -- trigger when somebody goes down (y spread becomes small and they stop moving)
**** Partnering at 7:20 -- I'll do a variation on the slide/inversion gestures, but I've no idea what you can read. It seems to go from set pose to set pose, so I guess (relative) pauses versus activity would be the most feasible/helpful.

* Environment building
  1. Clean install directories.
  2. Get debian packages needed to build sc (if not already done).
     sudo apt-get install build-essential libjack0.100.0-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev libicu-dev libreadline6-dev libfftw3-dev libxt-dev pkg-config scons git-core subversion
  3. Check out and build sc (r10246).
     mkdir ~/share
     cd ~/share
     svn co -r10246 https://supercollider.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supercollider/trunk sc-svn
     cd sc-svn/common
     scons
     cd ~/share/sc-svn/common/build/SCClassLibrary/Common/GUI
     svn update -r 10373 Model.sc

     cd ~/wherever/you/want
     git clone http://jamshark70@github.com/jamshark70/kc_affectations.git
  7. Private extensions --> ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions.

	cp trunk/sc-private-extensions.tar.gz ~/aDir
	cd ~/aDir
	tar -xvzf sc-private-extensions.tar.gz
     2. mkdir ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
     3. cp *.sc ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
     4. tar -xvzf fixes.tar.gz ~/share/sc-svn/common/build/SCClassLibrary
