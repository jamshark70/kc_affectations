**** DONE Distinguish locomotive themes?
***** Stephen: S-curve
***** Ilana: Quick direction changes - basicSynthChooser; parm groups
***** Laura: Long arc, interruptions - add pitch right away, but big ones on the poses
****** TODO Different chords
****** TODO Map SynthDef probabilities into patterns
***** Sequence:
      1. 0:00 - 1:53 - S, I(2), L(3)
	 Mini-bangs?
	 S --> I, fade out S and sudden burst from I
	 I --> L, pause then build energy to L's entrance
	 Catch brief stop toward end as anacrusis to #2
      2. 1:53 -  :   - S3, I3, L3 (internal variations)
	 BANG to start this!
      3. Multispeed (part of L3 actually)
      4. S+I+L counterpoint - quite short, just play all sounds together
	 Another bang?
***** New sequence
      1. S - pause with I
      2. I - stop! (low density, then higher when Stephen starts)
      3. L - pause, then go, low pitch prob, 3 poses, little pause before...
      4. S - denser, slinky
      5. I - basically straight thru
      6. L - pause, poses, multispeed
      7. To corners, all 3 together

****** Locomotive
***** +Axial (3 levels)
***** +S&I (plus bass and bell mel)
***** +Manipulation
***** Something when Laura goes to the back
***** Locomotive - explode!
****** Drop Stephen solo proc - had enough axial
***** Rocking chords (c. 45 sec)
****** Need melody
***** Little bit to prepare L's solo
***** L's solo
**** Notes
***** First locomotive: too long, no differentiation (data) - now has melody!
***** Are chords too generic?
****** mimic accel/ritard rhythm from locomotive, but melodically and more space between phrases
****** I hear a more bell-like sound for it, maybe spectrum like Shiva but other envelope
***** Make sure canon is heard @ Shiva
***** Prepare 3 levels better
***** Interludes between axial sections: variations of something with identity (not like now)
***** Explode activity after manipulation
***** Whole arms section lacks rhythm
****** Locomotive: Coordinate some notes into rhythm
****** Rhythm 4 stacking?
****** Rocking
**** Work on Laura's solo, then foreshadow
**** TODO Revisit thin sections
***** Need bass
**** TODO Rewrite Laura's solo
***** Extend axial notes into locomotive texture - big sweeps going way up!
****** Reuse melody, but faster
***** Design gestures to follow movement
***** Rhythm?
***** As she leaves, push sounds into distance

*** TODO Body [0/1] <2011-01-04 Tue>
**** TODO Recall more cues
** Programming [1/4]
*** TODO Place to put in IP address/port
*** DONE Voicer events need different arg handling
    - GCs look to control bus - right? (no, if it's not a key) - needed?

* Cue list
  Segments are in 3rd-level headings (***)
  Event cues in a segment are numbered

    2. Third of 3
*** F50-changing speeds
*** F55-hop!
*** F60-stop(short) when they come to a line and all stop moving
*** F70-axial -- head bowing or just before is a good spot
*** F80-walking(swinging)
*** F90-3 inversions -- first is Laura's slide between Stephen and Ilana
    1. Second of 3 moves
    2. Third of 3
*** F100-hop/lean -- segment cue on the hop
    1. (Quickly!) Event cue when they stop and lean
*** F110-Conflict -- segment cue on the first military turn
    Note, this advanced automatically in the first version but is now
    cued
    1. Event cue on second turn
*** F115-small leans back and forth (see 7:26 in residency video)
*** F116-military turns
*** F120-falling - start with Ilana's fall
    This is a more complicated cue.
    1. (Quickly!) Once during the 3 poses after Ilana falls
    2. When Stephen falls
    3. When they start trading places falling down
    4. When Stephen goes into a handstand with just the feet illuminated
*** F130-military turns
*** F140-normal+inversions - when they start walking normally
    1. When Stephen goes into a gymnastic pose on Laura and Ilana's shoulders
    2. When they scatter to the three corners - next segment cue
       comes quickly!
*** F150-multispeed - when Laura starts walking VERY slowly
    1. Event cue when Stephen and Ilana come in
*** F160-Partnering - runs by itself

** Arms
*** A500 -- first statement of axial theme
    1. One event cue per arm gesture = one melody note
*** A510 -- first statement of locomotive theme
    1. each event cue makes an arpeggio -- I can automate these if it will be easier
*** A520 -- sunrise
*** A530 -- hand stacking
*** A540 -- partnering
*** A550 -- Shiva (axial)
    1. As before, one event cue for each arm gesture
*** A560 -- more partnering
*** A570 -- axial theme, three levels
    1. As before, one event cue for each arm gesture
*** A580 -- Stephen and Ilana duet
    1. Event cues trigger sequences of one or more chords -- these could be automated too
*** A590 -- locomotive (short)
    1. event cue = arpeggio (also open to automation)
*** A600 -- manipulating Laura
    1. As before, one event cue for each arm gesture
*** A610 -- another short locomotive section
    1. event cue = arpeggio (also open to automation)
*** A620 -- Stephen solo
    1. Like the earlier axial music, one event cue for each arm gesture
*** A630 -- cradling gesture
*** A640 -- Laura solo
*** A650 -- fade out to make silence before the face dance

** Head

    1. Event trigger to raise the chaos level
    2. Event trigger for silence
*** H1500-Drones start (currently plays automatically)

** Torso
*** T2000 - getting set for the first torso theme (right around 28:30 in the residency video)
*** T2010 - as Laura and Ilana leave before Stephen's solo (30:20)
    1. Event cue as Stephen speeds up for the hopping gesture -- hit this as he starts to speed up (31:20), so the musical gesture reaches full steam when he's moving fastest
    2. A second event cue a little later (same action) (31:53)
*** T2020 - Ilana enters (32:06)
    1. Event cue for the same motion (32:32) - *before* Laura comes in

*** T2070 - when they start to slow down (35:04)
*** T2080 - when Ilana goes up onto the platform (OK to hit this as she is heading for the platform) -- let this run through Stephen's shorter solo (35:31)
*** T2090 - Ilana's solo (36:24) - at her first pause with the light on her torso
*** T2100 - Stephen and Laura's duet (37:20-ish)

** Body

    1. Event triggers for successive axial moves (like arm section).
	When she starts moving arms and torso, slow down the triggers.
*** B2510 - At the restart of the axial sequence -- very short cue!
*** B2520 - Locomotive theme, in place. Another very short cue.
*** B2530 - Hit this when she stops in the triangle shape.
*** B2540 - Restart axial sequence -- very short, as in 2510.
*** B2550 - Locomotive in place, short like 2520.
*** B2560 - Wild arm movements.
*** B2570 - Coming...

  4. Check out and build sc3-plugins (r444).
     cd ~/share/sc-svn
     svn co -r444 https://sc3-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sc3-plugins sc3-plugins
     cd sc3-plugins
     scons
     sudo scons install
  5. Check out quarks (r1629).
     1. In sc/emacs, "Quarks.gui"
     2. Select dewdrop_lib, MathLib and cruciallib (buttons at left).
     3. Click "save" and wait (it may issue several svn co commands).
  6. Check out my git repos.
     cd ~/wherever/you/want
     git clone http://jamshark70@github.com/jamshark70/kc_affectations.git
  7. Private extensions --> ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions.
     1. Extract trunk/sc-private-extensions.tar.gz into a separate directory.
	cp trunk/sc-private-extensions.tar.gz ~/aDir
	cd ~/aDir
	tar -xvzf sc-private-extensions.tar.gz
     2. mkdir ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
     3. cp *.sc ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
     4. tar -xvzf fixes.tar.gz ~/share/sc-svn/common/build/SCClassLibrary
     5. cd ~/share/sc-svn/common
     6. sudo scons install
  8. Restart sc interpreter.
** DONE Check all private-extensions into git.
