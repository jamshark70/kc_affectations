** Head [1/2]
*** DONE [#A] [6/6] combine harmonics, vocalization and drums

***** DONE Spatialize: push \int to back of space
**** DONE Tighten drone pacing - tentatively done
**** DONE [3/3] When/how to add drums?
***** DONE Doublecheck drum pacing

***** DONE Drum mixer levels
**** DONE Pull all the init stuff together
***** DONE what clock should int use?
**** DONE Why are notes so quiet compared to drone?
**** DONE Merge formants into drone
*** TODO [#C] LPC for face/section start


* Residency <2010-09-27 Mon>--<2010-10-02 Sat>
** TODO Place to put in IP address/port
** Data for Lorne:
*** Position data
*** Other CC data
*** Note data per instrument
** TODO [1/5] Data extraction notes
*** DONE Feet
    How many feet are moving?
    Together or separate?
    Pauses (and triggers for the three poses in Laura's theme).
    Hop.
    Direction? Their 90 degree turns will be awfully hard to read, but very useful.
    We talked about animated circles or ovals appearing on screen in sync with the footsteps. I could use triggers for those.
    1:51 -- slinky -- maybe measure their distribution by averaging the X positions? (mean - xmin) / (xmax - xmin) will be lower when Stephen is further to the left
    I'm having trouble imagining distinguishing characteristics for the walking. I know there are three locomotive themes that the dancers do sometimes together and sometimes in counterpoint. Distinguishing them musically is a "nice to have" for me but only if I have time left over after working on the sections where I don't have any material. We might have to navigate through the different walking constructions based on the segment-to-segment cues that Lorne will do by hand.
    Pause at 2:00 -- and hop to start moving again
    2:30 -- a musically useful pause, but how to read their movement toward backstage?
    2:35 -- movement in canon, going into Laura's three poses
    2:50 -- multiple speeds -- speed shouldn't be too hard to read
    3:36 -- slower movements, adding arms -- for the music, here I have a sketch of building harmony by overlapping two-note chords, would be nice to trigger these based on their movements, or if not trigger directly, then control pacing by their level of activity
    4:02 -- I don't know how much you can get when they are lying on their backs -- some parameters for their degree of leaning? If technically feasible
    4:34 -- walking again -- can we get any of the arm swinging?
    4:49 -- I really love that gesture -- I know it's hard to read. All three parts -- Laura's slide, the inversion, and the other inversion -- have some higher-speed movement followed by a pause. Maybe some continuous data going higher when they are in transition between poses? (I'm writing more about this because it's such great movement, and I want to do something special musically for it.)
    5:19 -- stop walking, and lean -- another musically suggestive gesture! They're moving horizontally before the lean -- I'd watch for the feet to separate and the neck marker to move to the right of the feet.
    5:35 -- "conflict" -- important musically but not sure how to read in video.
    5:46 -- from camera distance, I can't make out what's happening here.
    6:10 -- "falling" section -- also important to represent musically -- one figure's markers will have a very low y spread during the fall
    6:28 -- height variation
    6:52 -- multiple speeds (something comic here?)
    7:20 -- partnering work -- new to me. Unclear what's readable here.
    7:35 -- lifts and twirls. Would like to have some musical activity when they spin, maybe a variation of the measurement in the arms interaction demo.

***** DONE Tongue comes out, open mouth: start vocalization
      What should I do?
      Where should I go?
      Why is it this way, and not that?
      Who is listening?
      Who is watching?
****** DONE Fatten pitched synth
***** DONE Smile and other emotions: vocal chatter


** Torso
*** TODO [0/1] Watch video!
**** TODO What to do with the hopping theme?
**** Pauses on the box
*** Sounds [4/4]
**** Silences!
**** DONE Bells
**** DONE Washes
     Reuse waterpad - move feet process to here!
     Keep/throw out tinkly combs?
     --- would really like to have wash fade in/out, then tinkles follow -- separate from VC
**** DONE Melody
     Reuse melody PR from arms, new notes, slower rhythms, shorter phrases
     Sound? Maybe inharmonic at first, becoming clearly pitched
**** DONE Tinkly things
     Raise pitch and speed up rhythm of low bells - nice
     Nice for Stephen's solo, with melodic fragments
     Faster movement = more tinkles (don't speed up melody too much) -- pitch contours
     Later, integrate tinkles with chords(?) -- rework Klank as effect
