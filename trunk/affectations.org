* Cue list
  Segments are in 3rd-level headings (***)
  Event cues in a segment are numbered
** Feet
*** F1-Bang!
*** F10-Ilana joins
*** F20-Laura joins
    :ANNOTATION:
    The event cues happen when they stop in the three poses backstage right.
    :END:
    1. First of 3 poses
    2. Second of 3
    3. Third of 3
*** F30-Stephen pattern (@2:45 in 12-01-10_walking?)
*** F40-slinky (backstage, moving closer and further apart)
    1. Three or four event cues as desired
*** F50-Restart Ilana's pattern
*** F60-Restart Laura's pattern + 3 poses
    1. First of 3 poses
    2. Second of 3
    3. Third of 3
*** F70-changing speeds -- Laura starts moving very slowly
*** F80-3 patterns in counterpoint -- when they split up for the original corners where they entered
*** F90-stop(short) when they come to a line and all stop moving
*** F100-axial -- head bowing or just before is a good spot
*** F110-walking (swinging)
*** F120-3 inversions -- first is Laura's slide between Stephen and Ilana
    1. Second of 3 moves
    2. Third of 3
*** F130-hop/lean -- segment cue on the hop
    1. (Quickly!) Event cue when they stop and lean
*** F140-Conflict -- segment cue on the first military turn
    1. Event cue on second turn
*** F150-small leans back and forth (see 8:36 in 12-01-10_walking)
*** F160-military turns
*** F170-falling - start with Ilana's fall
    This is a more complicated cue.
    1. (Quickly!) Once during the 3 poses after Ilana falls
    2. When Stephen falls
    3. When they start trading places falling down
    4. When Stephen goes into a handstand with just the feet illuminated
*** F180-military turns
*** F190-normal+inversions - when the military turns stop
    1. When Stephen goes into a gymnastic pose on Laura and Ilana's shoulders
    2. When they scatter to the three corners - next segment cue comes quickly!
*** F200-multispeed - when Laura starts walking VERY slowly
    1. Event cue when Stephen and Ilana come in
*** F210-Partnering - when the motion changes away from simple walking
** Arms
*** A500 -- first statement of axial theme: when they separate and arms come up
    1. One event cue per arm gesture = one melody note
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger fires the first note. Event triggers fire successive notes. The idea is to catch each arm motion. It's okay if you miss one or two -- would add variety to the rhythm.
    :END:
*** A510 -- first statement of locomotive theme: when they start moving
    1. 1-3 event triggers to start a melody playing. (Event triggers during the melody are ignored.)
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger launches. Event triggers cause a melody to play. I haven't thought about what enough movement should make that happen. One event trigger starts the melody and it runs on its own. Event triggers are ignored until the melody stops.

    I'm using y-span / x-span to decide note density and the rate at which the notes rotate around the virtual space.
    :END:
*** A520 -- sunrise: when Stephen joins L&I backstage left and arms make an arc
    :ANNOTATION:
    Just a segment trigger. This is where Ilana and Laura are to the left (from the audience's point of view), then Steven slides over and joins them, and they all make an arc with their hands from left to right. The segment trigger should happen when they start the arc or just before (probably makes sense to look at Stephen coming over).
    :END:
*** A530 -- hand stacking: when the three kneel together
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger. This starts when they kneel to the floor.

    When I detect that the height (y-max) is increasing, the base pitch goes up; when decreasing, it goes down. Timing of the movement may be an issue -- not a good idea to take significantly longer (pitches will go too high), or to take much longer to come down than to go up (too low).
    :END:
*** A540 -- partnering: after breaking out of the stacking pose
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger only, when they break out of the hand stacking position.
    :END:
*** A550 -- Shiva (axial)
    1. One event cue per arm gesture = one melody note. Segment trigger fires the first note.
    :ANNOTATION:
    Like A500. Segment trigger fires the first note. Event triggers fire successive notes.
    :END:
*** A560 -- more partnering: after breaking out of the Shiva pose
    1. One event trigger -- plays a few Shiva notes.
    2. (Optional) event trigger for a bit of locomotive material, but only if there's time.
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger to start, like A540, when they move away from the Shiva posture. You should hit one event trigger a few seconds later -- that makes a few Shiva notes play. Some more things happen on their own. One more event trigger is possible, but optional, later, to do a little bit of the locomotive material.
    :END:
*** A570 -- axial theme, three levels
    1. One event cue per arm gesture = one melody note. Segment trigger fires the first note.
    :ANNOTATION:
    Like A500. Segment trigger fires the first note. Event triggers fire successive notes.
    :END:
*** A580 -- Stephen and Ilana duet: after breaking out of the three-levels pose
    1. Event trigger for second chord (when S&I are embracing).
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger (as Laura is starting to lie down) makes a bass glissando and one chord. Event trigger makes a second chord. Probably best to trigger that sometime when they're embracing. It plays on its own after that.
    :END:
*** A600 -- manipulating Laura: when they pick Laura up
    1. One event cue per arm gesture = one melody note. Segment trigger fires the first note.
    :ANNOTATION:
    Like A500. Segment trigger fires the first note. Event triggers fire successive notes.
    :END:
*** A610 -- loco-prep: when Laura disappears behind S&I
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger only. Intended for this to happen when Laura goes behind them.
    :END:
*** A620 -- another short locomotive section: when Laura bursts to the front between S&I
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger, should be timed when Laura bursts to the front between Stephen and Ilana.
    :END:
*** A630 -- cradling gesture: L&I's entrance from left
    :ANNOTATION:
    Just a segment trigger, but I wrote the sequence so that we could cue the materials visually (by event triggers). Let's talk about that.
    :END:
*** A640 -- Laura solo: Laura's re-entrance from right
    :ANNOTATION:
    Segment trigger, materials triggered by continuous data. Don't worry about it :)
    :END:
*** A650 -- fade out to make silence before the face dance
    :ANNOTATION:
    This is still left over from October -- I need to fix it so that the fadeout is slow and gradual, maybe controlled by their x position.
    :END:
** Head
*** H1000-Start of face dance
    1. 1 event trigger for creaking --> door sound
*** H1010-Lights come up, Ilana starts rolling her tongue in her mouth
*** H1020-Mouth opens, tongue starts peeking out a bit (2 tongue-out-to-side gestures first)
*** H1030-Ilana starts smiling and showing other emotions (as she starts to close her mouth)
    1. (I will probably remove this one) +Event trigger to raise the chaos level+
    2. Event trigger for silence
*** H1500-H1650-Drones start (currently plays automatically)
    :ANNOTATION:
    These are structured as cues, but in fact they are automatically timed. Each cue in H1530-H1650 represents one phrase of "sung" material.

    Event triggers under #2:
    ID=1 -- when triggered, this will fade out the drones
    ID=2 -- when triggered, this starts the disintegration
    :END:
    1. Event cue when the three dancers kneel side by side on the floor
    2. Two event cues that overlap. They may fire in any order.
       ID=2 -- after breaking out of the "metronome" gesture and going to the floor
       ID=1 -- at your discretion, sometime after H1650 runs

** Torso
*** T2000 - hit this about 20-30 seconds before they are in the initial stationary torso pose
*** T2010 - as Laura and Ilana leave before Stephen's solo (30:20)
    :ANNOTATION:
    Hit #1 and #2 as he /starts/ to speed up (31:20), so the musical gesture reaches full steam when he's moving fastest
    :END:
    1. Event cue as Stephen speeds up for the hopping gesture
    2. A second event cue a little later (same action) (31:53)
*** T2020 - Ilana enters (32:06)
    1. Event cue for the same motion (32:32) - *before* Laura comes in
*** T2030 - energy exchanges (32:53)
*** T2040 - ensemble work when they all rise to stand (33:22)
*** T2050 - as Ilana is starting to go down to the floor (33:53)
*** T2060 - when they start moving quickly as an ensemble (34:45)
*** T2070 - when they start to slow down (35:04)
*** T2080 - when Ilana goes up onto the platform (OK to hit this as she is heading for the platform) -- let this run through Stephen's shorter solo (35:31)
*** T2090 - Ilana's solo (36:24) - at her first pause with the light on her torso
*** T2100 - Stephen and Laura's duet (37:20-ish)

** Body
   :ANNOTATION:
   Cues B2500-B2560 may change considerably, since I need to rewrite this transition.
   :END:
*** B2500 - Segment trigger on the first arms axial move.
    1. Event triggers for successive axial moves (like arm section).
	When she starts moving arms and torso, slow down the triggers.
*** B2510 - At the restart of the axial sequence -- very short cue!
*** B2520 - Locomotive theme, in place. Another very short cue.
*** B2530 - Hit this when she stops in the triangle shape.
*** B2540 - Restart axial sequence -- very short, as in 2510.
*** B2550 - Locomotive in place, short like 2520.
*** B2560 - Wild arm movements.
*** B2570 - Stephen touches Laura's arm/shoulder after her solo (42:48)
    A melody plays here for a bit less than a minute. When that's over, hit the next one.
*** B2580 - drums 1 -- drums will start after a few seconds -- I can make this more immediate later
*** B2590 - the first foreshadowing of Ilana's suspension (45:38)
    :ANNOTATION:
    It's incredibly hard to describe the "foreshadowing" in words. I want to make an association between lifting Ilana and supporting her by her torso (kind of like she's flying) and the upward arpeggios. These can occur a few seconds in advance of the actual lift, but I really wouldn't like it if they are too late.
    :END:
*** B2600 - second foreshadowing (47:05, just before)
*** B2610 - last suspension (48:17-ish)


* Schedules


* January open studio
** Interaction
*** The axial melody and variations;
    One or two of the swipes -- maybe up + down or left + right, so the player could get a sequence of notes by moving back and forth vertically or horizontally.
*** Locomotive arpeggios;
    Circle or wave.
*** Various types of chordal material (musical gestures are more distinct);
    Swiping on the axis that is not used for #1.
    use directional marker (avg) data for pitch direction
*** Bass support that would work with #2 or #3;
    Push.
    Process isn't good for on-the-fly reset
    Triggers while it's already playing will be dropped
*** A faster, kind of bouncy tune in a bell like sound.
    Jump.

* Environment building
** HW/OS specs
   - Intel Core i3-350M, 2.27 GHz
     - feel free to go faster
     - Core i5 or i7 will probably not benefit too much because scsynth uses only one thread for DSP)
   - 4 GB RAM (but if you're just running SuperCollider, you won't even need half that)
   - HD can be moderate speed
   - OS: Ubuntu 10.04 (10.10 is newer but I've heard of audio system bugs).
     http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download

** OS configuration
   After installing the OS (writing this from memory, hope it's okay):
   1. Don't bother with system updates at first.
   2. Go to Applications > Ubuntu Software Center and install linux-realtime.
   3. /Then/ reboot and you can do security etc. updates after that.
   4. Go to System > Administration > Software Sources
      - Add http://ppa.launchpad.net/falk-t-j/lucid/ubuntu on the Other Software tab.
   5. Install the jack2 package (which comes from the PPA).
      - If Jack v1 is installed (shouldn't be), uninstall it manually before installing Jack2.
      - Also install JACK Control (simplifies configuration).

** SC building
   1. Clean install directories.
   2. Get debian packages needed to build sc (if not already done).
      sudo apt-get install build-essential libjack0.100.0-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev libicu-dev libreadline6-dev libfftw3-dev libxt-dev pkg-config scons git-core subversion
   3. Install the Emacs meta-package.
      sudo apt-get install emacs
   4. Check out and build sc.
      mkdir ~/share
      cd ~/share
      git clone git://github.com/jamshark70/sc34-affectations.git sc.git
      cd sc.git/common
      scons
      sudo scons install
   5. Check out and build sc3-plugins (r444).
      cd ~/share/sc.git
      svn co -r444 https://sc3-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sc3-plugins sc3-plugins
      cd sc3-plugins
      scons
      sudo scons install
   6. Add the following into ~/.emacs:
      ; Mandatory
      (require 'sclang)

      ; If you want to have access to the help system
      ; the "normal" way in Emacs, install packages "w3m" and "w3m-el-snapshot"
      ; and uncomment this in .emacs
      ; (require 'w3m)

      ; More intelligent buffer switching by C-x b
      (iswitchb-mode 1)

      ; The toolbar wastes space
      (tool-bar-mode -1)
   7. Install SwingOSC.
      1. Download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/swingosc/.
      2. Copy (or symlink) the SuperCollider/ directory into ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions.
      3. Create ~/.sclang.sc with this text.
         JSCTextEditBase.useBorder = false;

         g = SwingOSC.default;
         g.options.javaOptions = "-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.nimbus.NimbusLookAndFeel";

         // put the location of SwingOSC.jar in this line
         SwingOSC.program = "~/share/SwingOSC/build/SwingOSC.jar".standardizePath;

         fork {
        	 2.5.wait;
        	 g.waitForBoot {
        		 var	w;
        		 s.makeGui;
        		 1.0.wait;
        		 w = Window.allWindows.detect { |win| win.name == "localhost server" };
        		 if(w.notNil) {
        			 w.bounds = w.bounds.right_(Window.screenBounds.width).top_(30);
        		 }
        	 }
         };

         // must not load Instr's until class tree init is finished
         // INCLUDING StartUp.add actions set up by *initClass methods
         // b/c I create some Spec.specs in there

         StartUp.add {
        	 // note, after step 9, put the real path in here
        	 Instr.dir = "/path/to/kc.git/trunk/Instr/";
        	 Instr.loadAll;
         };

      4. Edit to supply the correct location of SwingOSC.jar.
   8. Check out quarks.
      1. Launch SuperCollider-emacs.
	 1. /usr/bin/emacs -sclang &
      2. Execute "Quarks.gui"
      3. Select these using the buttons at left.
	 1. dewdrop_lib
	 2. ddwGUIEnhancementsForSwingOSC
	 3. ddwTimeline
	 4. MathLib
      4. Click "save" and wait (it may issue several svn co commands).
   9. Check out my git repos.
      cd ~/wherever/you/want
      git clone http://jamshark70@github.com/jamshark70/kc_affectations.git
   10. Private extensions --> ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions.
       1. Extract trunk/sc-private-extensions.tar.gz into a separate directory.
 	  cp trunk/sc-private-extensions.tar.gz ~/aDir
 	  cd ~/aDir
 	  tar -xvzf sc-private-extensions.tar.gz
       2. mkdir ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
       3. cp *.sc ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
       4. cp WrappableInstr ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions
	  - Steps related to the old fixes.tar.gz should NO LONGER be needed.
       5. Edit ~/.sclang.sc to specify the actual location of trunk/Instr for Instr.dir.
   11. Restart sc interpreter.
** DONE Check all private-extensions into git.
