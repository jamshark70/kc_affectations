#+STARTUP: hidestars

* Essentials


* Schedules


* January open studio
** Interaction
*** The axial melody and variations;
    One or two of the swipes -- maybe up + down or left + right, so the player could get a sequence of notes by moving back and forth vertically or horizontally.
*** Locomotive arpeggios;
    Circle or wave.
*** Various types of chordal material (musical gestures are more distinct);
    Swiping on the axis that is not used for #1.
    use directional marker (avg) data for pitch direction
*** Bass support that would work with #2 or #3;
    Push.
    Process isn't good for on-the-fly reset
    Triggers while it's already playing will be dropped
*** A faster, kind of bouncy tune in a bell like sound.
    Jump.
** To-dos [4/5]
*** DONE Bus index for continuous data
*** DONE IP for sending "midi"
*** DONE Add vizdata wrapper to 5 procs
*** DONE Balances
*** TODO More use of continuous data

**** DONE Distinguish locomotive themes?
***** Stephen: S-curve
***** Ilana: Quick direction changes - basicSynthChooser; parm groups
***** Laura: Long arc, interruptions - add pitch right away, but big ones on the poses
****** TODO Different chords
****** TODO Map SynthDef probabilities into patterns
***** Sequence:
      1. 0:00 - 1:53 - S, I(2), L(3)
	 Mini-bangs?
	 S --> I, fade out S and sudden burst from I
	 I --> L, pause then build energy to L's entrance
	 Catch brief stop toward end as anacrusis to #2
      2. 1:53 -  :   - S3, I3, L3 (internal variations)
	 BANG to start this!
      3. Multispeed (part of L3 actually)
      4. S+I+L counterpoint - quite short, just play all sounds together
	 Another bang?
***** New sequence
      1. S - pause with I
      2. I - stop! (low density, then higher when Stephen starts)
      3. L - pause, then go, low pitch prob, 3 poses, little pause before...
      4. S - denser, slinky
      5. I - basically straight thru
      6. L - pause, poses, multispeed
      7. To corners, all 3 together

*** T2010 - as Laura and Ilana leave before Stephen's solo (30:20)
    1. Event cue as Stephen speeds up for the hopping gesture -- hit this as he starts to speed up (31:20), so the musical gesture reaches full steam when he's moving fastest
    2. A second event cue a little later (same action) (31:53)

*** T2080 - when Ilana goes up onto the platform (OK to hit this as she is heading for the platform) -- let this run through Stephen's shorter solo (35:31)
*** T2090 - Ilana's solo (36:24) - at her first pause with the light on her torso
*** T2100 - Stephen and Laura's duet (37:20-ish)

*** B2550 - Locomotive in place, short like 2520.
*** B2560 - Wild arm movements.
*** B2570 - Stephen touches Laura's arm/shoulder after her solo (42:48)
    A melody plays here for a bit less than a minute. When that's over, hit the next one.
*** B2580 - drums 1 -- drums will start after a few seconds -- I can make this more immediate later
*** B2590 - the first foreshadowing of Ilana's suspension (45:38)

* Environment building
** HW/OS specs
   - Intel Core i3-350M, 2.27 GHz
     - feel free to go faster
     - Core i5 or i7 will probably not benefit too much because scsynth uses only one thread for DSP)
   - 4 GB RAM (but if you're just running SuperCollider, you won't even need half that)
   - HD can be moderate speed
   - OS: Ubuntu 10.04 (10.10 is newer but I've heard of audio system bugs).
     http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download

** OS configuration
   After installing the OS (writing this from memory, hope it's okay):
   1. Don't bother with system updates at first.
   2. Go to Applications > Ubuntu Software Center and install linux-realtime.
   3. /Then/ reboot and you can do security etc. updates after that.
   4. Go to System > Administration > Software Sources
      - Add http://ppa.launchpad.net/falk-t-j/lucid/ubuntu on the Other Software tab.
   5. Install the jack2 package (which comes from the PPA).
      - If Jack v1 is installed (shouldn't be), uninstall it manually before installing Jack2.
      - Also install JACK Control (simplifies configuration).

** SC building
   1. Clean install directories.
   2. Get debian packages needed to build sc (if not already done).
      sudo apt-get install build-essential libjack0.100.0-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev libicu-dev libreadline6-dev libfftw3-dev libxt-dev pkg-config scons git-core subversion
   3. Install the Emacs meta-package.
      sudo apt-get install emacs
   4. Check out and build sc.
      mkdir ~/share
      cd ~/share
      git clone git://github.com/jamshark70/sc34-affectations.git sc.git
      cd sc.git/common
      scons
      sudo scons install
   5. Check out and build sc3-plugins (r444).
      cd ~/share/sc.git
      svn co -r444 https://sc3-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sc3-plugins sc3-plugins
      cd sc3-plugins
      scons
      sudo scons install
   6. Add the following into ~/.emacs:
      ; Mandatory
      (require 'sclang)

      ; If you want to have access to the help system
      ; the "normal" way in Emacs, install packages "w3m" and "w3m-el-snapshot"
      ; and uncomment this in .emacs
      ; (require 'w3m)

      ; More intelligent buffer switching by C-x b
      (iswitchb-mode 1)

      ; The toolbar wastes space
      (tool-bar-mode -1)
   7. Install SwingOSC.
      1. Download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/swingosc/.
      2. Copy (or symlink) the SuperCollider/ directory into ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions.
      3. Create ~/.sclang.sc with this text.
         JSCTextEditBase.useBorder = false;
        
         g = SwingOSC.default;
         g.options.javaOptions = "-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.nimbus.NimbusLookAndFeel";
        
         // put the location of SwingOSC.jar in this line
         SwingOSC.program = "~/share/SwingOSC/build/SwingOSC.jar".standardizePath;
        
         fork {
        	 2.5.wait;
        	 g.waitForBoot {
        		 var	w;
        		 s.makeGui;
        		 1.0.wait;
        		 w = Window.allWindows.detect { |win| win.name == "localhost server" };
        		 if(w.notNil) {
        			 w.bounds = w.bounds.right_(Window.screenBounds.width).top_(30);
        		 }
        	 }
         };
        
         // must not load Instr's until class tree init is finished
         // INCLUDING StartUp.add actions set up by *initClass methods
         // b/c I create some Spec.specs in there
        
         StartUp.add {
        	 // note, after step 9, put the real path in here
        	 Instr.dir = "/path/to/kc.git/trunk/Instr/";
        	 Instr.loadAll;
         };

      4. Edit to supply the correct location of SwingOSC.jar.
   8. Check out quarks.
      1. Launch SuperCollider-emacs.
	 1. /usr/bin/emacs -sclang &
      2. Execute "Quarks.gui"
      3. Select these using the buttons at left.
	 1. dewdrop_lib
	 2. ddwGUIEnhancementsForSwingOSC
	 3. ddwTimeline
	 4. MathLib
      4. Click "save" and wait (it may issue several svn co commands).
   9. Check out my git repos.
      cd ~/wherever/you/want
      git clone http://jamshark70@github.com/jamshark70/kc_affectations.git
   10. Private extensions --> ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions.
       1. Extract trunk/sc-private-extensions.tar.gz into a separate directory.
 	  cp trunk/sc-private-extensions.tar.gz ~/aDir
 	  cd ~/aDir
 	  tar -xvzf sc-private-extensions.tar.gz
       2. mkdir ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
       3. cp *.sc ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/PrivateExtensions
       4. cp WrappableInstr ~/share/SuperCollider/Extensions
	  - Steps related to the old fixes.tar.gz should NO LONGER be needed.
       5. Edit ~/.sclang.sc to specify the actual location of trunk/Instr for Instr.dir.
   11. Restart sc interpreter.
** DONE Check all private-extensions into git.
