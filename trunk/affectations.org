*** DONE Feet
    How many feet are moving?
    Together or separate?
    Pauses (and triggers for the three poses in Laura's theme).
    Hop.
    Direction? Their 90 degree turns will be awfully hard to read, but very useful.
    We talked about animated circles or ovals appearing on screen in sync with the footsteps. I could use triggers for those.
    1:51 -- slinky -- maybe measure their distribution by averaging the X positions? (mean - xmin) / (xmax - xmin) will be lower when Stephen is further to the left
    I'm having trouble imagining distinguishing characteristics for the walking. I know there are three locomotive themes that the dancers do sometimes together and sometimes in counterpoint. Distinguishing them musically is a "nice to have" for me but only if I have time left over after working on the sections where I don't have any material. We might have to navigate through the different walking constructions based on the segment-to-segment cues that Lorne will do by hand.
    Pause at 2:00 -- and hop to start moving again
    2:30 -- a musically useful pause, but how to read their movement toward backstage?
    2:35 -- movement in canon, going into Laura's three poses
    2:50 -- multiple speeds -- speed shouldn't be too hard to read
    3:36 -- slower movements, adding arms -- for the music, here I have a sketch of building harmony by overlapping two-note chords, would be nice to trigger these based on their movements, or if not trigger directly, then control pacing by their level of activity
    4:02 -- I don't know how much you can get when they are lying on their backs -- some parameters for their degree of leaning? If technically feasible
    4:34 -- walking again -- can we get any of the arm swinging?
    4:49 -- I really love that gesture -- I know it's hard to read. All three parts -- Laura's slide, the inversion, and the other inversion -- have some higher-speed movement followed by a pause. Maybe some continuous data going higher when they are in transition between poses? (I'm writing more about this because it's such great movement, and I want to do something special musically for it.)
    5:19 -- stop walking, and lean -- another musically suggestive gesture! They're moving horizontally before the lean -- I'd watch for the feet to separate and the neck marker to move to the right of the feet.
    5:35 -- "conflict" -- important musically but not sure how to read in video.
    5:46 -- from camera distance, I can't make out what's happening here.
    6:10 -- "falling" section -- also important to represent musically -- one figure's markers will have a very low y spread during the fall
    6:28 -- height variation
    6:52 -- multiple speeds (something comic here?)
    7:20 -- partnering work -- new to me. Unclear what's readable here.
    7:35 -- lifts and twirls. Would like to have some musical activity when they spin, maybe a variation of the measurement in the arms interaction demo.
*** DONE Arms
    8:09 -- axial theme -- ideally I would get triggers for each gesture. Whether they come from video analysis or manual intervention doesn't matter to me.
    8:35 -- locomotive theme -- we already have the arms-interaction demo. In a couple of places, the dancers stop and move hands up together. The demo doesn't currently respond to that, but I'd like to make it do so. In those places, is it possible to read most of the points being relatively still while some in the middle move upward, and track the upward motion?
    9:09 -- "sunrise" -- would be very nice to have data about where they are in the arc
    9:15 -- hand stacking -- I hear little arpeggios in the music, not sure if each arpeggio needs to be triggered individually from video. It's probably enough to get a signal saying "stacking now" and then another saying "they're going down now," then "that bit's over."
    9:28 -- intricate sequence -- a pause with hands clasped behind backs, then the partnering bit flipping Ilana upside down, a repeat of Laura's slide from the feet section (I like recurring motives like this!), leading right into 9:40. I would love to know when the slide is happening, to echo the earlier musical gesture.
    9:40 -- "Shiva" -- locomotive theme in canon.
    10:10 -- swaying --> partnering. Still thinking what to do here. Probably some punctuation sound, instead of trying to compose to every movement. I'll need to decide where the triggers should be, or maybe the triggers don't have to be in the same place every time.
    10:36 -- axial theme, three levels
    11:10 -- duet partnering -- Before, I read this as Stephen teaching Ilana the axial sequence -- curiously, that relationship disappears with a smoother performance.
    11:43 -- manipulating Laura -- triggers similar to the regular axial presentation would be useful. Music and visuals should give the audience permission to laugh here!
    12:00 -- Laura becomes more active in the partnering, leading into the locomotive theme (short)
    12:06 -- Stephen's solo, wild movements -- arm positions relative to the rest of the body might be the most useful thing
    12:17 -- new material, interesting juxtaposition of cradling next to something that looks like drawing a bow. Fragments of the axial and locomotive themes -- for my stuff, it would be nice to know when which one or the other is happening.
    12:47 -- all three to the ground, then up
    13:01 -- Laura solo, mostly locomotive material, probably can reuse the arms-interaction code, but I think it should be more sparse there
    14:14 -- hand play, should start with the bleeps and bloops for the face dance

* TODO For premiere
  DEADLINE: <2010-10-21 Thu>
** Feet
*** Notes
**** Silence when Laura walks in slowly (multispeed part toward end)
*** Sounds/processes [6/7]
**** DONE Harmony w/ arms - refine
**** DONE Slide/inversion gesture    
**** DONE [#A] Multiple speeds
     Coming... want to modulate between no pitch, normal pitch and "crispy" pitch
**** DONE Leaning - sketched, come back to this after doing multiple speeds
**** DONE Falling - reuse leaning, and extend clicky things
**** DONE Conflict - prototyped, stomping and snare-drumming
**** TODO [#C] Distinguish locomotive themes
*** Data needed from Lorne
**** The entire opening sequence, up to about 3:30, there isn't much to read except stepping speed (foot markers going up and down) and the horizontal spread between the dancers. Their speeds may be different -- that's useful for me to know.
**** c. 3:30 -- slower, more harmony -- movement velocity
**** lying on backs -- another buildup leading to this, then hold (a) chord(s)
***** the more they swing their legs, the more activity
**** slide and inversions -- three triggers
**** leaning -- they're stationary -- I'd like to know when they stop moving
**** conflict -- can we tell when they change direction (attack/retreat)?
**** Falling -- trigger when somebody goes down (y spread becomes small and they stop moving)
**** Partnering at 7:20 -- I'll do a variation on the slide/inversion gestures, but I've no idea what you can read. It seems to go from set pose to set pose, so I guess (relative) pauses versus activity would be the most feasible/helpful.

*** Data to send to Lorne

**** How does this flow with the existing music?
*** Sounds/processes [0/0]
*** Data needed from Lorne

      What should I do?
      Where should I go?
      Why is it this way, and not that?
      Who is listening?
      Who is watching?

**** DONE Bells
**** DONE Washes
     Reuse waterpad - move feet process to here!
     Keep/throw out tinkly combs?
     --- would really like to have wash fade in/out, then tinkles follow -- separate from VC
**** DONE Melody
     Reuse melody PR from arms, new notes, slower rhythms, shorter phrases
     Sound? Maybe inharmonic at first, becoming clearly pitched
**** DONE Tinkly things
     Raise pitch and speed up rhythm of low bells - nice
     Nice for Stephen's solo, with melodic fragments
     Faster movement = more tinkles (don't speed up melody too much) -- pitch contours
     Later, integrate tinkles with chords(?) -- rework Klank as effect
**** TODO Steady pitches with modulation based on movement
*** Data needed from Lorne
*** Data to send to Lorne


** Body
*** Notes
**** Laura's solo: lpc chaos toward end, then bells/space from torso
**** How to work in hints of drums?
**** Stephen's feet on Ilana's back - fantastic!
*** Sounds/processes [0/0]
*** Data needed from Lorne
*** Data to send to Lorne
