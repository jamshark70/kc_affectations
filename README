===============

This project consists of development-grade code for the generative music written for an interactive multimedia dance piece to be performed in Washington DC in October 2010.

This code does not compile to a static executable! It includes a lot of loose experimentation that is probably not useful to anyone except the author. The project will not be extensively documented.

Code is in SuperCollider. SC users are welcome to read the code to glean possibly useful tricks.

I respectfully ask users not to commit anything into this repository. Unauthorized changes will be swiftly reverted.
